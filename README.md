#MyBB Openfire Integration

First published at 24th September 2008 on https://mods.mybb.com/view/openfire-integration.
A very easy and simple add-on.

This add-on registrate MyBB registrations automatically to the Openfire Server. So you can own a Instant Messaging Server (based on Jabber) for your MyBB Users. The solution here is realized with the User Service Plugin for Openfire . But there are many other Integrate solutions with Openfire. Openfire supports the LDAP authentication, too.

The only problem of this integration solution: Existing MyBB users must manually registering to the Openfire server.

## Requirements
MyBB 1.4 (higher than 1.4 not tested)
Openfire: http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/index.jsp
User Service plugin for Openfire: http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/plugins/userservice.jar

# Installation

After choose your language simply upload openfire.php to inc/plugins in your MyBB Root.
